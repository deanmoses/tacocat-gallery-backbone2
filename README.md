##How To Work With Project On A New Box##
Trying to get this down to the simplest and stablest possible.
Get project
Install Git
git checkout [tacocat gallery project]
Install stuff for working with project
Node.js
Compass (server side CSS munging)
This requires installing Ruby
Yeoman
This is a npm install, which also installs Bower and Grunt
Build project for development & preview locally
cd [project root]
grunt (build project)
grunt server (starts server and pops up browser with index page, and autorefreshes browser each time a file changes)
Build project for production and deploy to Tacocat
TBD
